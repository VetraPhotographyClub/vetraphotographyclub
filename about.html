    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="slide-in-right">We are a group of passionate photographers who meet weekly to share tips, go on photo walks, and capture the beauty of our city. Our club welcomes members of all skill levels – from beginners to professionals – to learn from each other and improve our craft.</p>
    <p class="slide-in-right">Founded in 2010, the Photography Club has grown into a community of friends who not only take photos together but also organize exhibitions and workshops for the public. We believe photography is a powerful art form that tells stories and preserves memories.</p>
